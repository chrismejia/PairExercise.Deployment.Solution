# Heroku Deployment & CI/CD

## Intro

- [x] Pre-reading
  - There's a nice shortcut that's (as far as I know) built-in to **VSCode**: type `html` into a blank HTML and it gives you a blank HTML5 boilerplate.
- [x] Goal
  - Understood
- [x] Starting Point
  - Installed
  - Created both DBs
  - Test check - **ALL PASSING**
  - Ran seed file - gave `seeded` message
  - Ran `start-dev`
  - Visited localhost:3000 - 5 people present
  - Examined app structure

## Heroku

- [x] What is Heroku?
  - Pre-readings were useful here.
- [x] The 12-factor app
  - Again, useful readings
- [x] Install the Heroku CLI
  - Signed up on site
  - Went through CLI instructions
  - Can see help menu on `heroku` command
- [x] create
  - logged in from before
  - bikeshedding is a very interesting term for a common issue
  - settled on `some-cool-app`
  - works; created in root directory and not in the clone repo - whoops
  - created new (`some-other-app`) in create repo folder; works - shows heroku
- [x] deploy
  - Returned notification that app is deployed
  - React app is **not** running - site error
    - Something about its type being HTML and not JS...

      some-other-app.herokuapp.com/:1 Refused to execute script from 'https://some-other-app.herokuapp.com/bundle.js' because its MIME type ('text/html') is not executable, and strict MIME type checking is enabled.

      </details>
  - Gave me an awesome log with no errors:

- [x] logs
  - I can see myself using bash pipelining, **specifically** the highlighted StackOverflow best answer A LOT.
    - Super useful shell command: `heroku logs -t | grep 'error'`
  - Tried `heroku logs --tail`

    </details>
  - `heroku logs -t | grep 'error'` gave me nothing
- [x] Deploying build artifacts
  - Ran `npm run deploy`
  - Browser gave a `500 Internal Server Error`
    - `Network` tab examination reveals the 500 comes from a broken `/users` route

## Heroku Add-ons

- [x] Add the Heroku postgres add-on
  - Located and added
- [x] Heroku run bash
  - Ran bash and the seed file
  - Live project now runs without issues.

## Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

- [x] What is Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)?

  - From the StackOverflow answer:

  ```
  What's the difference between these three terms? My university provides the following definitions:

  Continuous Integration basically just means that the developer's working copies are synchronized with a shared mainline several times a day.

  Continuous Delivery is described as the logical evolution of continuous integration: Always be able to put a product into production!

  Continuous Deployment is described as the logical next step after continuous delivery: Automatically deploy the product into production whenever it passes QA!

  They also provide a warning: Sometimes the term "Continuous Deployment" is also used if you are able to continuously deploy to the test system.

  All this leaves me confused. Any explaination that is a little more detailed (or comes with an example) is appreciated!
  ```

  - [ ] Should make flashcards for all three...

- [x] Travis and .travis.yml
  - No issues; triggered a build and it passed; as expected
- [x] Encrypting your Heroku auth token
  - ran `heroku-token`
  - got the key
  - pushed; errored - WRONG APP NAME
  - fixed app name and it worked!

## DONE
